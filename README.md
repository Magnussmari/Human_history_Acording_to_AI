**Every year of recorded human civilization. Structured. Sourced. Machine-readable.**

An autonomous AI research daemon is writing the history of the world -- one year at a time, from 2025 CE backward to the dawn of writing (~3200 BCE). Parallel agents run around the clock, producing structured JSON with events, primary sources, confidence levels, geographic coordinates, anti-sycophancy checks, and graph edges linking cause to consequence across millennia.

This is not a textbook. It is a **structured knowledge corpus** designed for graph databases, timelines, adversarial review, and further AI reasoning. Every claim names its source. Every confidence level is justified. Every gap is declared, not hidden.

> **Live status:** Check [`state/progress.json`](state/progress.json) -- the daemon updates it after every cycle.

## Optimization Case Study

This project went through a significant cost and speed optimization mid-run. Here's the story:

### Phase 1: Claude Code CLI (Max Subscription)

The initial daemon used `claude -p` (Claude Code CLI) with a Max subscription:
- **Cost model:** Subscription-based, fair-use quota
- **Problem:** Constant rate limiting during work hours, restricted to off-hours schedule
- **Token overhead:** ~3.5x due to agent tools, system prompts, permission handling
- **Speed:** 5 years per 20-minute cycle
- **Result:** 304 years completed before optimization

### Phase 2: Optimization Analysis

Used **Kimi Agents** to review the repository and spec the optimization -- an AI agent analyzing another AI agent's workflow. The Kimi analysis identified:
- The `claude -p` CLI adds ~3.5x token overhead vs. direct API calls
- Tiered model selection could match model cost to year complexity
- Batch processing (5 years per API call) enables massive throughput gains
- Response caching eliminates re-processing on retries

### Phase 3: Claude Code Plan Mode Migration

Fed the Kimi optimization spec into Claude Code, which:
1. Entered **plan mode** to design the migration strategy
2. Identified all files needing modification and the exact changes
3. Built a complete Python implementation (`api_client.py`, `orchestrator_optimized.py`, etc.)
4. Deployed and tested on the remote server via SSH
5. Validated with single-year and parallel batch tests before switching over

### Phase 4: Haiku Experiment (Failed)

Initial API migration used tiered models with Haiku for batch processing. Quality comparison revealed:
- Haiku produced **thinner output** -- shorter descriptions, fewer cross-references, empty geographic_coverage_gaps
- Sonnet (both CLI and API) produced **A+ quality** -- rich sourcing, nuanced certainty notes, proper gap declarations
- **Decision:** Haiku not up to the task for historical research. All Haiku outputs moved to `outputs/haiku_experiment/` and those years queued for Sonnet re-research.

### Phase 5: Sonnet 4.6 for All (Current)

Now running with Claude Sonnet 4.6 for every year, via direct Anthropic API:
- **Model:** Claude Sonnet 4.6 exclusively (quality over cost)
- **Cost per year:** ~$0.20 via direct API
- **Batch processing:** 5 years per API call for throughput
- **Speed:** 25 years per 60-second cycle (vs. 5 years per 20 minutes)
- **Schedule:** Runs 24/7 -- no subscription quota limits
- **Estimated completion:** ~4-5 days (vs. 70 days originally)
- **Every output has `_meta`:** Model, cost, method, and timestamp tracked per year

### The Takeaway

| Metric | Before (CLI) | After (API) | Improvement |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Cost per year | $0.22 | $0.003 (Sonnet batch) | 99% cheaper |
| Years per cycle | 5 | 25 | 5x throughput |
| Cycle interval | 20 min | 60 sec | 20x faster |
| Schedule | Off-hours only | 24/7 | No restrictions |
| Est. total time | 70 days | 3-4 days | 20x faster |
| Est. total cost | ~$1,150 | ~$17 (actual API spend) | 98.5% cheaper |

**Key techniques:** Direct API calls (eliminate CLI overhead), model quality testing, batch processing, response caching, async Python with controlled concurrency.

### Model Experiments

We tested multiple models to find the optimal quality/cost balance:

| Model | Events/year | Cost/year (batch) | Quality | Verdict |
|-------|------------|-------------------|---------|---------|
| **Claude Sonnet 4.6** | 20-25 | $0.003 (actual) | A+ | **Selected** -- rich sourcing, nuanced certainty |
| Claude Haiku 4.5 | 10-15 | $0.009 | B+ | Rejected -- thin descriptions, empty gap declarations |
| Gemini 3 Flash | 6 | ~free | B | Rejected -- valid schema but too sparse |

Haiku outputs are preserved in `outputs/haiku_experiment/` and Gemini in `outputs/gemini_experiment/` for comparison.

**Future candidates worth testing:** GPT-4.1 batch (~$0.016/year, 1M context), DeepSeek R1 (~$0.009/year, reasoning chains), Qwen3-235B (~$0.004/year, strong APAC coverage).

**Update (April 2026):** OpenAI released GPT-5.4 with 1M context, reasoning effort controls (`none` through `xhigh`), and CFG grammar constraints for structured output enforcement. At $2.50/$10.00 per 1M tokens (batch: $1.25/$5.00), its batch output pricing ($5.00/M) undercuts Sonnet's ($7.50/M). Planned for adversarial validation pass after the Sonnet corpus is complete -- two models cross-referencing the same years is stronger than one.

## What Each Year Contains

Every year produces a single JSON file following the **ICCRA schema** (see [`RESEARCH_PROMPT.md`](RESEARCH_PROMPT.md)):

```json
{
  "year": 1066,
  "year_label": "1066 CE",
  "era_context": "High medieval period...",
  "documentation_level": "rich",
  "geographic_coverage_gaps": ["Sub-Saharan Africa", "Southeast Asia"],
  "events": [
    {
      "id": "1066-001",
      "title": "Battle of Hastings",
      "region": "England",
      "category": "military",
      "description": "...",
      "key_figures": ["William, Duke of Normandy"],
      "sources": [{"name": "Bayeux Tapestry", "type": "primary_text", "contemporary": true}],
      "certainty": "confirmed"
    }
  ],
  "disconfirming_evidence": "...",
  "historiographic_note": "...",
  "graph_edges": [{"from": "1066-001", "to": "1086-001", "relation": "led_to"}],
  "_meta": {
    "model": "claude-sonnet-4-6",
    "cost_usd": 0.22,
    "duration_seconds": 260
  }
}
```

**Key design principles:**
- **No fabrication.** Empty events with honest era_context > hallucinated entries.
- **Anti-sycophancy protocol.** Every year must surface contradicting evidence.
- **No anachronism.** Period-appropriate framing only.
- **Global coverage.** Gaps are declared, not hidden.
- **Source typing.** Primary text, archaeology, chronicle, or oral tradition -- named, not assumed.

## Run It Yourself

### The Meta-Prompt

Copy this into any AI agent. Self-contained, no dependencies:

~~~
You are a historical research agent. Produce structured JSON for a single year.

YEAR TO RESEARCH: [INSERT YEAR, e.g., 1453 or -3200]

RULES:
1. Negative years = BCE (e.g., -3200 = "3200 BCE"). Positive = CE.
2. Research significant events across ALL regions.
3. Modern years: 15-25 events. Ancient: 0-5. Zero is acceptable.
4. Every event names its source. "General knowledge" is not acceptable.
5. Every event has a certainty level: confirmed/probable/approximate/traditional/legendary.
6. Include "disconfirming_evidence" -- what's disputed about this year?
7. Include "geographic_coverage_gaps" -- what regions are you missing?
8. Do NOT fabricate. Empty events with honest context > hallucinated entries.
9. Respond with VALID JSON ONLY.

SCHEMA: {"year": int, "year_label": str, "era_context": str,
"documentation_level": "rich|moderate|sparse|minimal|negligible",
"geographic_coverage_gaps": [str], "events": [{id, title, region,
category, description, key_figures, sources, certainty, certainty_note}],
"disconfirming_evidence": str, "historiographic_note": str,
"graph_edges": [{from, to, relation, note}]}

## Interactive Frontend

A Next.js 16 timeline app lives in [`/frontend`](frontend/) -- built with shadcn/ui, TanStack Virtual (handles 5,226 years smoothly), and a dark ancient-history aesthetic.

**Features:**
- Virtualized timeline with year cards, era navigation, category/certainty filters
- Full year detail pages with events, sources, disconfirming evidence, graph edges
- Search (Cmd+K) across all events, figures, and descriptions
- Live progress banner from `state/progress.json`
- GitHub Actions auto-aggregates data into 100-year chunks on every push

**Data flow:** The daemon produces individual JSON files -> `scripts/aggregate-data.mjs` chunks them into 100-year blocks -> the frontend loads chunks on demand.

**Deploy:** Import the repo on Vercel, set root directory to `frontend`.

---

## Quality Assurance

The corpus is validated continuously with Python scripts:

```bash
# Full ICCRA schema validation (categories, certainties, sources, structure)
python3 scripts/validate_corpus.py

# Fix compound categories ("political | military" -> "political")
python3 scripts/fix_categories.py

# Backfill _meta on files missing model/cost tracking
python3 scripts/backfill_meta.py
```

**Latest validation pass: 100% valid** (1,140 files, 11,283 events, 0 errors).

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| JSON structure | All files parse cleanly |
| Required fields | year, year_label, era_context, events, disconfirming_evidence -- all present |
| Category values | 11 valid categories, compound categories auto-fixed |
| Certainty values | 5 valid levels: confirmed (80.6%), probable (15.7%), approximate (3.5%) |
| Source attribution | 99.98% of events have named sources |
| Model tracking | `_meta` field on every file with model, method, timestamp |

**Crash-safe and idempotent:** Progress persists on host volume. Docker restarts on reboot. Locks prevent double-processing. Cache prevents re-spending on retries.

## Methodology

A custom research workflow developed by Magnus, built on the ICCRA schema:

- **ICCRA schema** -- Intent, Context, Constraints, Reporting, Authority
- **Anti-sycophancy protocol** -- Mandatory disconfirming evidence
- **Source typing** -- Primary, archaeological, epigraphic, numismatic, chronicle, oral tradition
- **Certainty calibration** -- Five-level confidence with justification
- **Geographic equity** -- Explicit gap declaration for underrepresented regions
- **Graph-native** -- Every event has edges connecting causes and consequences
